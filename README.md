# Car dealership PostgreSQL and Django app
"Databases" subject project, a "Car Dealership" application using PostgreSQL and Django. 
The main requirement from the instructor was to implement the entire business logic using a database management system, using "raw" SQL queries without relying on ORM solutions. 
In addition to queries, I implemented various functions, procedures, and triggers using PL/pgSQL
